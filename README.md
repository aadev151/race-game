# race-game

## It is...
... a game which was created with PyGame. It is my first PyGame game and I did it when I was 12 years old, so please, do not judge!

## Story
Well, there ain't no story, really, but let it be like this...

You are in a hurry, you overslpet and now are driving to your office. There is a huuuuuuge traffic jam (nothing surprising because you're in a hurry). So, you decided to turn into the oncoming traffic. Now, your main aim is not to crash. Hope, you'll do alright! :)

## Features
Well, quite a few of them.
1. Two languages: Russian and English
2. A possibility to change your nickname
3. Dark mode (yet only for the game itself, not for the menu)
4. Four maps of various difficulties
5. Fun-mode (available only in Russian; press 0 while choosing the difficulty)
6. Two-players mode
7. Eight cars with different health and manageability
8. Progress saving

## Bugs
Yes, it is highly likely that there are pretty many of them. If you find any, feel free to write me on [vomisina.xela@gmail.com](mailto:vomisina.xela@gmail.com)
